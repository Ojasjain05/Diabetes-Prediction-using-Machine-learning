Diabetes is a serious metabolic condition where elevated blood sugar levels persist over time, leading to both immediate and long-term health risks. Early symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, and increased hunger. If left unmanaged, diabetes can result in life-threatening complications like diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. Over time, it can lead to chronic issues such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and impaired vision.

The dataset for this analysis comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and its goal is to predict diabetes in patients using various clinical factors. The data comprises diagnostic measurements like insulin levels, glucose concentration, and BMI. A key characteristic of the dataset is its focus on a specific demographic group: female patients of Pima Indian descent aged 21 or older. This dataset serves as a vital resource for developing machine learning models aimed at accurate diabetes prediction and early detection.

# Objective:

The objective is to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to accurately predict diabetes in female Pima Indian patients based on key diagnostic measurements, aiding in early detection and management.

# Detail about the Dataset:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

# Result:
The Accuracy of the Machine Learning Model using Support Vector Machine is

Accuracy of Training Data: 78.6%

Accuracy of Testing Data: 77.2%
